A full-stack **blogging web application** where users can write and interact with blogs using likes, dislikes, comments, shares, and follows. Built with a powerful backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and rendered with EJS templating for polished user experience.

> **Note:** The primary focus is on backend robustness and clean architecture. Frontend is functional with great UX; responsiveness/UI polish is planned in future iterations.
