My aim is to build a Blog Web app with minimalistic design and loaded with features. It won't contain irrelevant sections like About us, contact us, our work etc and will provide only relevant things to user.

It will include simple registation and login pages for Swift authentication of users, user can read blogs, but some features need to have there account with us. 

The homepage will include multiple sections for featured, latest and trending blogs, event adds and categories as well. 

There will be an add Blog page that allow any registered user to share his thoughts. 

The all blogs page will display all blogs based on category or filter selected. 

Single Blog Page will display each Blog in detail, there will be a follow button to author, like dislike, comments and related blogs section. 

It includes simple header and footer that will be consistent throughout the application. Header will have search bar to search blogs in that page and and sidebar that activate on hamburger. Sidebar will have multiple quick links and Categories.
Footer will be simple, having feedback box, quick links and privacy policy along with account managing button.

User ID page might be the main attraction.
It display the username, a follow button, his avatar, bio and number of followers, followings and blogs written by him. And later on the posts written by him. If user is seeing his own profile he will see change avatar and edit profile button and he will see the delete button for his blogs.

Your work for now is to make design consistent across all pages including fonts, colours, don't size and weight, shadows and interactions etc.
Make updates to look the pages more better.

Later, to learn about .ejs files and how to use them as components with customised data. 
To standardise the css by adding colour variables, font family, weight and size variables, and default styling on global css file to avoid conflicts when merging the pages. 

Manage which page to be open and with what data on visiting a particular link. Pass various relevant routes and actions on all functionalities to work seemless with backend. 

And last to make every page responsive to tablets and phone screens.
